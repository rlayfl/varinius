# Varinius: Exploring Simulation Variables and Physiological Stress

This project investigates the effects of various variables in a maritime navigation simulation on participants' physiological stress responses.

## Introduction

When playing online competitive games that involve controlling a character in a simulated dangerous environment, players often report feelings of stress. Whether it's the end of a round in Counter-Strike, hiding from enemy players in Arma, or speaking to a simulated ghost in Phasmophobia, these scenarios tend to evoke a stress response, even though there is no real danger to the player themselves.

Understanding exactly what it is about these scenarios that triggers a stress response could be useful in preparing individuals for real-life high-stress situations, such as those faced by police officers, military personnel, and maritime professionals.

This project focuses on maritime navigation as the resources available dictate that this should provide the most effective data.

## Methodology

The experiment will see participants have some of their physiological stress responses measured in a non-invasive manner, while undertaking simulated maritime navigation tasks in Unreal Engine 5. Each task will be designed such that one variable is different to allow for effective identification of any correlation. Furthermore, all participants will be asked to complete the same tasks.

The physiological stress responses measured will be:

- Blink rate
- Heart-rate and heart-rate variability
- Galvanic skin response (GSR)

The user will also be asked to complete a post-task interview to understand their subjective point of view on their stress levels.

## Variables

The variable are split into two categories:

- Audio/Visual (AV) variables
- Decision stressors

### Audio/Visual Variables

Four AV variables will be changed. These are:

- Light
- Weather
- Simulated sounds of people in distress
- Vague horror noises (actually recordings of deer and foxes)

### Decision Stressors

4 Decision stressors will be used. These are:

- Information overload
- Time Pressure
- Complexity
- Competition

### Fractional Factorial Design

Due to the use of 8 binary variables, there would be 2^8 (256) combinations of experiments to undertake to gather data on every combination. To maximise efficiency, a fractional factorial design will be used, with a resolution of IV (4) to gather data but keep the number of individual experiments down. This would therefore be 16 experiments with some allocated to undertake additional experiments should variables be aliased. 

### Levels

Based on the fractional factorial design, 16 levels will be created matching the fractional factorial design chart.

## Expected Results

It is predicted that identified decision stressors are likely to cause more of a feeling of stress than audio or visual variables in the simulation itself. However, this is just from anecdotal experience.

## Ethical Considerations

When carrying out experiments which are designed to invoke some sort of stressful reaction from participants, it's important to understand that while some may enjoy the experience, it's possible for others to have adverse reactions and have measures in place to mitigate and risks involved.
